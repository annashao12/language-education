The data are downloaded in a CSV to make the data easier to read as a human, although this CSV file is never actually used in the code, instead, an API key was used to extract the necessary data directly from the US Census Bureau database.\nThe data are then trimmed down to only the necessary variables which can be used to create the plot. the tidycensus and tidyverse libraries were used in this project. No observations were explicitly removed, however those that were not being looked at were not used."

The relevant variables were pulled to analyse the relationship between language spoken at home and education rate. While Spanish speakers seem to be at a disadvantage when it comes to education, speakers of other languages are doing almost as well as English speakers."
